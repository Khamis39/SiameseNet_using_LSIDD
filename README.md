# SiameseNet_using_LSIDD
A system or network may be compromised by malicious users who try to access it without authorization. To prevent this, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are employed. One of the applications of few-shot learning is in natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing, as well as in Internet of things, robotics and healthcare domains, where it shows high performance and accuracy. In this paper, we present a few-shot meta-learning-based solution using Siamese Neural Network and similarity function that can quickly identify and classify malicious and benign classes. This solution is very useful in recent years due to the increase of malicious traffic. We use the Large scale intrusion detection dataset (SIDD), which contains network traffic protocol communication-based images from 15 different observation locations. Our proposed model achieves better results than the previous papers that used the same dataset, with an accuracy of 0.98 on test set and an F1-Score of more than 0.98
